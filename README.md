### ðŸ‘· [Coverage overview](docs/coverage.md)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to run a set of e2e tests to a Gnosis Safe interface. This can be specially helpful when developing features for the Gnosis Safe web interface, as a quick check of all the interface features.

### Installing and running

Install dependencies for the project:
```
yarn install
```

Run using the config in your `.env` file. If no .env is defined this command will use `dev` environment
```
yarn test
```

To test a local instance of the project:
```
yarn test-local
```
It should be running at http://localhost:3000/


To run against a PR instance:
```
PR=xxxx yarn test-pr
```


More testing environments can be check at [utils/config.js](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-react-e2e-tests/blob/develop/utils/config.js)

### Environment variables
It's highly recommended to defined environment variables in order to setup a testing environment. The app is able to pick environment variables from the `.env` file. Copy our template to your own local file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### MNEMONIC (REQUIRED)
A MNEMONIC is required to initialize Metamask and have the first owner key

#### PRIVATE_KEY_GROUP (MINIMUM 1 IS REQUIRED)
A list of private keys can be set in order to add more owners to Metamask. They should follow the list format in one line:
```
"0xPrivateKey1, 0xPrivateKey2, 0xPrivateKey3"
```

#### PASSWORD (REQUIRED)
A password to unlock Metamask

#### TESTING_SAFE_ADDRESS (REQUIRED)
An address of an already deployed safe to be used during the tests

#### FUNDS_RECEIVER_ADDRESS (REQUIRED)
An address to use as receiver on those tests where sending funds is involved. It should be one of the owners from the Safe

NON_OWNER_ADDRESS (REQUIRED)
An address that is controlled by the user but is not an owner of the safe
